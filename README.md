ofxOpenVR 
====================
Implementation of Valve Software's [OpenVR](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr) API.
This addon lets create VR applications (using HTC Vive) on openFrameworks, Windows 10. It's forked from smallfly's addon. 

The most important fix comparing original version is about 
problem of one eye's vertical shift due matrices computations errors.
There are also many smaller improvements, for example, draw_... function for fastest rendering left eye's scene on the screen without additional computations.

## Requirements

* HTC Vive (though, it is not required to compile projects, just to deploy)

* Visual Studio 2017

* openFrameworks 0.10.1

* ofxOpenVR addon, which should be placed to openFrameworks/addons/ofxOpenVR. 

## Using addon

* To check VR is working, compile and run addonâ€™s examples located 
in **openFrameworks/addons/ofxOpenVR**.
Note, examples are tested in 64-bit mode and they must contain 64-bit version of **openvr_api.dll**.

* In your own projects, create the project using **Project Generator**, and
copy **openvr_api.dll** file to the **bin** folder of the project from **copy_to_bin** addon's folder.

## Examples

* **example-360Player** - example of rendering panoramic image in VR using a shader.

* **example-drawing** - example of rendering lines and working with joysticks in VR.
Also, it demonstrates drawing geometry using a shader.

* **example-primitives** - the simplest Vr example which renders several points, lines and triangle in VR.
